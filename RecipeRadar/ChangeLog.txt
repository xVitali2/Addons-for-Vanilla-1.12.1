Recipe Radar ChangeLog

v1.11; September 18, 2006

- Fixed item linking bug (thank you, TDurden!).
- Fixed a bug that could occur for unlucky Dragonscale/Elemental LWers
  and Armorsmiths (thank you, Arilaw!).

v1.10; September 16, 2006

- I'd forgotten to enable specialization checking!  It should now work.
- Auctioneer and Recipe Book are now supported in the recipe icon
  mouseover.  Thanks very much to borohir for this functionality!

v1.9; September 5, 2006

- Recipes names are now cached when learned.  This should make new
  Blizzard patches less of a hassle.
- Availability checking now takes faction reputation and trade skill
  specialties into account.
- Adjusted some vendor information.
- Reduced memory usage significantly.

v1.8; July 11, 2006

- Several new German region names were missing in v1.7.  Hopefully they
  are all correct now.
- Adjusted some vendor information.

v1.7; June 24, 2006

- Fixed the nasty profession selection bug for non-English versions.
- Profession icons should now show up for non-English versions.
- Unlearning a profession should now be handled correctly.
- Fixed several new 1.11 German region names.
- Added the new 1.11 Cenarion Circle recipes.
- Several vendors were incorrectly marked as Alliance-only (thank you,
  Howlin!).

v1.6; June 21, 2006

- Added a right-click context menu to the scroll frame.  From this
  menu users can map vendors and expand/collapse all items.
- Fixed bug causing non-English profession stuff to suck (thank you
  ElKano and Jeremy Gurr!).
- Alts of a different team should no longer appear in the availability
  list.
- Adjusted the German translation.
- Adjusted some vendor locations.

v1.5; May 11, 2006

- All recipes that are named differently after learning (eg. transmutes)
  should now show up correctly as known or not.  This applies, in theory,
  to all locales.
- Revamped the filtering code and fixed filtering, I hope, for non-
  English versions.
- Nonapplicable professions and known recipes are now different filtering
  categories in both availability modes.
- Fixed the incompatibility with Metamap, more or less.
- Tweaked the German translation and some vendor locations.

v1.4; May 7, 2006

- Revised German translation (thanks to DJMars and Elkano!).
- Dropdown filters are now effected every time Recipe Radar is opened.
  Filters should now work much more intuitively.
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused an error message on startup and/or
  zone changes.
- Changed Alliance color to blue.
- Added a couple of missing vendors/recipes and improved the positions of
  several others.
- Enchant Bracer - Healing should now show up correctly as known or not.

v1.3; April 29, 2006

- Fixed a bug that was preventing about half of the maps from displaying
  on non-English clients.
- Adjusted some vendor locations.

v1.2; April 28, 2006

- Fixed chat message parsing bugs in non-English versions.
- Added an option to auto-map (but not auto-unmap!) contributive vendors.
- Added the number of learnable recipes to mapped vendor tooltips.
- Changed the '/rr' slash command to '/rrdr'.
- Map tooltips will hopefully no longer run off the screen.

v1.1; April 27, 2006

- Added support for the frFR locale. (I hope it works..)
- Added the ability to view regions other than the current region.  The
  relevant settings now appear in the Options frame.
- Instance vendors can no longer be mapped.
- Non-English versions should now be able to use the dropdowns (I hope).
- Now accounting for WoW's "Mithril Head Trout" bug - it should now show
  up correctly as known or not.

v1.0; April 24, 2006

- Initial public release!
