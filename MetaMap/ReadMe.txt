DESCRIPTION:
============
MetaMap adds features to the WoW world map, keeping all mapping type features in a single place.
Some features are:

Adjust the map window size.
Move the map anywhere on the screen.
Adjust the opacity of the window & maps.
Saved sets for toggling between 2 map modes.
Allows full player movement, messaging, etc. with map open.
Adds coords to the main map and the Minimap
Adds Instance maps which open to the correct instance you enter.
Default data included for all bosses & locations etc.
User editable notes for all maps, including instance maps.
NPC/Mob database collectable by mouseover or keypress.
Toggling on/off display of unexplored areas of the map.
Boss Loot Tables displays all the loot dropped by bosses, and more.
Waypoint system to guide you to any set point.
Inbuilt Import and export facilities for various data formats.
Inbuilt Backup and Restore facilities.
Button on Minimap to open or close the World Map or display MetaMap options.
Key bindings for various MetaMap functions.
Full support for Titan Bar.

INSTALLATION:
=============
Extract ALL folders in the archive to the Interface\AddOns\ location.
If you wish the Instance maps to be populated with default information,
then on first installation you will need to select 'Extended Options' from the MetaMap menu.
Select the 'Imports' tab, then click 'Load Imports'. This will enable the two default
import buttons, 'Import Instance Notes' and 'Import BLT data'. Click on the import button
for each to import the data. Future updates to these files will require the same procedure.

ISSUES/COMPATIBILITIES:
=======================
Some addons may reset the map to gather location data.
If your map continuously jumps back to your current location when selecting another map,
it will be due to another addon resetting it. In most cases the authors have made changes
to correct this so, download the latest version of any conflicting addon.

*******************************************************************************
                                  MAIN MAP
*******************************************************************************
The additions to the main WoW WorldMap were intended to fit in as smoothly as
possible, keeping the overall format the same. It adds not only Instance maps,
but also extends user editable notes to the Instance maps.

Options Menu: (also available in context from the Minimap button and TitanBar)
Menu on Click: Menu is displayed by clicking the button or on mouse-over.
Wrap ToolTip: Will wrap tooltip displays to WoW defined limit.
Show Main Coords: Toggles the display of the WorldMap coords.
Show MiniMap Coords: Toggles the display of coords on the MiniMap.
Notes Filter: Shows a Submenu which allows you to filter out notes on the map.
Allow clicks through map: Sets map to a passive mode to allow all
					mouse action through the map. Setting stored for each Saveset.
Map Mode: Switches between 2 saved map modes. Each set stores its own settings
					for Opacity, Scale and Action Mode.

Create notes with MapMod: New note creation is done with CT_MapMod rather than
					MetaMap's internal note creation. Both live quite happily with each
					other so, you can toggle between them at any time.
Knowledge Base: Displays the KB database window.
Show Unexplored Areas: Toggles the display of unexplored areas on the map.

Shift+LeftClick on Main map coords will insert location details into open message box.
Shift+LeftClick on Minimap coords will insert location details into open message box.
CTRL+LeftClick on Minimap coords will cycle through setable text colours.
Left button down to drag Minimap coords display to anywhere on the screen.

Map List:
Left Clicking an item in the list will ping the location on the map.
Right Clicking an item in the list will show the notes edit box.
CTRL+Click an item in the list on an instance map will show the bossloot table.

Keybindings set in the system keybindings section allow quick key toggles for:
Toggling the WorldMap.
Switching between the 2 Map modes.
Toggling Fullscreen setting.
Toggling Knowledge Base display.
Targetting a unit for inclusion in the Knowledge Base.
Toggling the QuickNote display.
Removing a Waypoint.


*******************************************************************************
                                KNOWLEDGE BASE
*******************************************************************************
This database stores the name, description and location of all the NPCs/mobs you
mouse over.  The location is stored as a range to allow for movement or various
spawn points.  The range is updated every time you find the NPC in a different
location.  The database is global - all your characters on the same
computer and account can access it.

The Auto tracking on mouse-over will only add information from NPC/MOB targets.
Would get pretty cluttered otherwise. However, there is also a 'manual' mode
via a Keybinding set in the system keybinding section. This method will also
allow a targeted Player unit to be added to the database.

You can create Notes when you need them (i.e. hunting a particular mob
or looking for a particular NPC) and then when things start to get cluttered
you can remove the notes for a particular NPC/mob or all from the QuickMenu.

LeftClicking on an item in the main KB window will pop up the QuickMenu with various
options. RightClick gives the option to set the item as a Waypoint.


*******************************************************************************
                              MAP NOTES
*******************************************************************************
Adds a note system to the WorldMap helping you keep track of interesting
locations.  This offers two main functions:

1. Marking notes on the WorldMap.
2. Showing one of these notes on the MiniMap as a MiniNote.

Map functions:
CTRL+LeftClick: On the WorldMap opens the note creator menu.
LeftClick: On a note opens the note editor menu.
RightClick on a note gives the option to set the note as a Waypoint.
Shift+LeftClick on a note will insert details into open message box.
CTRL+LeftClick brings up the Boss Loot Table (MetaMapBLT)
Mouse-over: On a Note to see the tooltip with the information you entered.

[Edit Menu]
With this menu you can create new notes and edit existing notes.

	1. Select the icon style you want to use for your note.
	2. Title: Enter it in the editbox and select a color in which it will be
			displayed in the tooltip.
			NOTE: The title field is mandatory, you cannot create a note without
			a title - to prevent this the "Save" button is disabled when
			the title field is empty.
	3. Infoline 1 and 2: Here you can insert additional information for your
			note and color it in one of the colors below the editbox.
	4. Creator: Enter the name of the player or AddOn that created the note

[The MiniNote]
A MiniNote is a note placed on the MiniMap.  Moving the mouse over the
MiniNote shows the details of the note.
To show one of your notes on the MiniMap go to the Worldmap, left click on
a note and choose "Set As MiniNote".
To hide the note on the MiniMap, you can go to the WorldMap, left click and
choose "Turn MiniNote Off".

The MiniNote is turned off if the MapNote corresponding to it is deleted.

[Send Notes To Other Players]
After clicking "Send Note" in the notes Menu the Send Menu will show up.

	1. Enter the name of the player you want to send a note to
			NOTE: Targeting the player before opening the WorldMap will auto
			insert the name.

	2. Send To Player
			Choose this option to send the note to the player entered above.

	3. Send To Party (requires Sky)
			This will send the note to the entire party. (No player name needs to
			be filled in.)

	4. Change Mode
			This toggles between Send To Player/Send To Party and Get Slash Command

	5. Get Slash Command
			Inserts a slash command in the editbox which can be highlighted and then
			copied to the clipboard.  After this you can post it on a forum or in chat
			and other MetaMap or MapNotes users can insert this note by copying the
			slash command to the chatline.

[Slash Commands]

/nextmininote [on|off], /nmn [on|off]
    Shows the next note created (using any method) as a MiniNote and also puts
    it on the WorldMap.  If invoked with no parameters, it will toggle the
    current state.

/nextmininoteonly [on|off], /nmno [on|off]
    Like the previous command, but doesn't put the note on the WorldMap.

/mininoteoff, /mno
    Turns the MiniNote off.

/quicknote [m] [xx,yy] [name], /qnote [m] [xx,yy] [name]
		Sets a note on the map in your current zone.
		The optional [m] parameter will set a mode for the note.
		1 = Set as Note + Mininote
		2 = Set as Mininote only
		3 = Set as a vNote (Virtual Note)
		No parameter or any other number for [m] will set as map note only.
		Coords and name are also optional.
		If no coords are entered, note is set at your current location.
 

*******************************************************************************
                             WAYPOINTS SYSTEM
*******************************************************************************
MetaMapBWP module adds a Waypoint system to MetaMap. A Waypoint arrow is displayed,
showing the direction of the point set.

USAGE:
A waypoint can be set by a number of methods:

1. Select a preset map note from the dropdown list displayed when clicking 'Set a Waypoint'
on the main MetaMap menu.
2. RightClick on any map note on the map.
3. RightClick on any entry in the MetaMap KB display.
4. By typing '/bwp xx,yy name' on the command line.

Both commandline parameters are optional. Results are as follows:
Coords only: Sets a Waypoint at specified location with default name of "QuickLoc".
Coords + Name: Sets a Waypoint at specified location with specified name.
No parameters: Sets a Waypoint at current location with default name of "QuickLoc".
Name only: Sets a Waypoint at current location with specified name.

The last two are useful if you need to mark your current location so you can easily
return to it at a later time. Note that you will need to turn off the
'Clear Waypoint on arrival' option for this to prevent it from being cleared.

The dropdown options menu can be accessed either by selecting 'Options' from the
preset Waypoints list, or by clicking on the main Waypoint display.

The Waypoints display can also be moved to any location on the screen by using the
RightButton down to drag it.


*******************************************************************************
                             DATA IMPORTS/EXPORTS
*******************************************************************************
MetaMap will import data for MapNotes, WoWKB, User saved notes, default Instance data,
and BLT/AtlasLoot data from a provided file placed in the MetaMapCVT folder.

NOTE: Files for import MUST be placed in the MetaMapCVT folder before starting WoW!

Files:
MapNotes: SavedVariables\MapNotes.lua (If you were previously running the MapNotes addon)
MapMod: SavedVariables\MapMod.lua (If you were previously running the MapMod addon)
User File: MetaMapEXP.lua Provided by another user, from download, or created by User export.
InstanceData: Included as standard in the MetaMapCVT folder.
BLT: Default data included for import as standard. This will additionally import
			AtlasLoot data should the need ever arise. Place the 'localization.en.lua'
			and 'localization.bg.en.lua' from AtlasLoot into the MetaMapCVT folder to import.

To import any data, click the 'Load Import Module' button after selecting the 'Import'
tab on the Extended Options Menu. This will load the required routines and data
files. Then select the import option required. 

For those wishing to export data to other users, simply click on the 'Export User File'
option in the Imports section. Either KB data or Notes data, or both can be exported.
This will create a file in the SavedVariables folder called 'MetaMapEXP.lua'.
Any MetaMap user can then place this file in their MetaMapCVT folder, ready for import.
They too, will have the option to import either set of data, or both.

05 August 2006 - v11100.4

11 August 2006 - v11100.6

	Updated routine that matches Mininote with existing map note to be totally unique.
	...(Previously took first name match, not taking into account multiples with same name).
	Slight change to the MiniCoords routine.
	...(Possible fix for the unexplainable 616 error a few were getting).

24 August 2006 - v11200-1
	Removed all AtlasLoot import options. Later versions of AtlasLoot are now totally incompatible.
	...(Default BLT import only for now, which I will keep updated).
	Fixed map opening to full screen. Will again open to correct scale setting.
	..(Looks like Blizz screwed up on the 'OnShow' function somehow).
	Fixed MetaMapBLT Dressing room not displaying character on opening.

	..(Load ZoneShift module and select 'Update Version' to update the tracker).
