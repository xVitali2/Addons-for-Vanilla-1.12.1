# NotGrid
Vanilla WoW Raid Frames
Use /notgrid for config menu
use /notgrid reset to restore default settings

If you're having issues with the frame borders/edges being un-uniformly sized or appearing clipped by the healthbar make sure to have a proper UI scale set. http://wow.gamepedia.com/UI_Scale TLDR: If you play with a 1920x1080 resolution, the correct UI scale would be 768/1080 = 0.7111..., and you would set that by typing /console UIScale 0.7111111111 in the chat.
