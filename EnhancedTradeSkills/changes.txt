v1.16 (2006/07/01 - 11100) - updated by Triadian
     updated to work with 1.11.1 patch
     fixed bug with the pet trainer and enchant windows
     new update to the enchant window to show the amounts of reagents as per all other craft windows
     changed all the slash commands from /tsf to /ets as the name changed a while ago
     changed the default settings from 1/1/1/1 to 1/1 as I feel this is a more popular option
     added a message to say settings have been reset after use of the /etsreset command
v1.15 (2005/10/13 - 1800)
     updated to work with 1.8 patch
     new event-handler added so that there is no need to overwrite blizzard craftUI-handlers any more
     new onload-handler added for better addon-initialsation (no dirty hack in eventhandler any more)
     added 2 dependencies from blizzard-ui for a fast update, so it works as before but does not take advantage of load on demand
     maybe i add support for load on demand in a future update, but i think a complete redesign would be necessary for that

     updated so that no files are necessary in folder FrameXML
     changed folder to "EnhancedTradeSkills", so be sure to delete the old one

     added information to the bottom panel about the number of skill items that you have in your inventory and bank
v1.10 (2005/02/24 - 4216)
     total reagent numbers in the bottom pane (after the reagent name, i.e., Plaguebloom [24] = have 24 total)
v1.9 (2005/02/22 - 4216)
     graphical configuration screen (/tsfconfig)
     support new interface number
     should now be compatible with European version (not translated, but buyable items should now be recognized)
v1.8 (2005/02/18 - 4211)
     added some significant performance improvements
       - invalidate inventory contents and update only when needed
       - deal with far too many TRADESKILL_UPDATE/CRAFT_UPDATE events coming in at odd times
           - probably still need to put in a rate limiter for this event
     fixed a few bugs in WOW base tradeskill/crafting screens
       - over indexing a call to GetTradeSkillInfo/GetCraftInfo
       - removed unnecessary calls to GetTradeSkillInfo/GetCraftInfo
     added /tsfreset to reset all filters and column display settings
     added a few missing buyable items
     infrastructure for localization, but no localizations (that will be a bit of work...)

     support new interface number
     add /help and /chelp support for Cosmos (thanks to Farmbuyer)

     changed 'stong flux' to 'strong flux' :) - should fix engineering and blacksmithing issues...
     improved performance for filtering in the case of no filters
     should not try to take over the Beast Training screen (for EN right now) - I don't have a hunter so I'm not sure if this really works...

     added another column to display (inventory + vendor)
     handle case where everything is buyable with '-' in the column
v1.3 (2005/1/23)
     fixed bug where the /tsf command would error out if the user had not visited the bank
     added support for enchanting, causing further encapsulation of code
     may have fixed poisons also...
